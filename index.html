        Hello, my name is Justin Ciocoi and I am an emerging Software Engineering and Information Security professional based in New York City. I recently graduated with my 
        Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Information Security in August 2024. Below you can find more information regarding my educational and work experience, 
        as well as my skills and various projects I have made. <i>Hover</i> over a box to see more. You can also download my resume <a target="_blank" href="public/Documents/Resume_11_1_24.pdf">here</a>

                I am currently a technical support intern at District Council No. 9 in Manhattan, and recently graduated
                from CUNY John Jay with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Information Security. 
                During my time there, my focus has been mainly on C++, Python, SQL, and cybersecurity including
                encryption, authentication, hashing, public and private key protocols, and more. I have spent much 
                of my time studying and using various Linux distributions (Mostly Debian and Arch) in both a 
                personal and academic capacity, and have a relatively deep understanding of most modern 
                operating systems. During my time as a student, I also worked as an in-office technical support
                intern for the funds office of the DC9 labor union in Manhattan. I was tasked with certain network 
                and system administration duties including database management and integrating new Windows 11 
                devices onto the network. I also have web design experience both in the production of enterprise 
                sites such as <a target="”_blank”" href="https://hisassoc.com">hisassoc.com</a> as well as personal 
                web-hosted projects that can be found under the <a href="public/projects.html">projects</a> section.
