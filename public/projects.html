                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project uses an automated BASH/ZSH script to store passwords in a vault directory on a home server with a pre-existing SSH connection to said home server</li>
                    <li>The rationale for building this tool comes from a variety of sources
                        <ul class="tinyList">
                            <li>The growth in value of digital assets possessed by most people and protected using passwords</li>
                            <li>The need for more complex passwords and the increased reliance on third party password managers</li>
                            <li>The potential for third party password manager data loss</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>This tool exists as a <i>backup</i> to traditional password managers rather than an alternative, as its capabilities are fairly limited</li>
                    <li>Since this tool simply encrypts whatever information is sent over the SSH connection, any text file containing sensitive information can be encrypted and saved in the vault as a backup</li>
                    <li>The project files for this project can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/justinciocoi/passwordVault">here</a> </li>
                    <li>This tool has been fully tested on MacOS Sonoma (Intel and Apple based), Debian Linux, and Arch Linux ARM</li>
                    <li>This tool has also been lightly tested on a Windows machine using WSL, but some behavior was buggy, and will be fixed in the future</li>
                </ul>

                            <li>This tool uses two shell scripts, one for encryption, and one for decryption</li>

                    <li>Many online tools like this exist, but with data security becoming more and more important, being able to run this tool locally and view the source code is highly valuable</li>
                    <li>While these tools are already easily accessible using terminal commands, this GUI was made both for ease of use and for less technical users</li>
                    <li>Users can simply paste a link, specify a format using the drop-down menu, select a destination directory, and download the content</li>

                    <li>As a big fan of the team, I wanted to do a project that combined a personal interest with a professional one</li>
                    <li>My initial intentions were to learn web development backends using node.js</li>
                    <li>However, as I spent more time looking at SQL data, I came to a few hypotheses that I wanted to check
