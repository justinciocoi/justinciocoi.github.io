                        <li>While I have focused on making more simple tools due to time constraints, I have a good understanding of scripting and integrating multiple terminal functions</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>SQL
                    <ul class="tinyList">
                        <li>I have set up mySQL database instances on my local machine</li>

                        <li>I have been regularly using MacOS for the past 7 years, and for the past year, it has likely been my most used operating system</li>
                        <li>I have the most experience writing software on macOS, although all of the software I have written for macOS has been compatible with Linux for the most part</li>
                        <li>I have recently learned a lot about the ARM architecture after having used Apple silicon for a few months</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Frequently Used Development Tools</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>SSH and OpenSSL
                    <ul class="tinyList">
                        <li>As a Computer Science and <i>Information Security</i> major, security is a large part of my approach to design and development</li>
                        <li>I have very often used SSH and openSSL to generate keys and create strong cryptographic networks</li>
                        <li>I have also used SSH to automate a variety of tools across my personal machines and home server</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Git and GitHub
                    <ul class="tinyList">
                        <li>I use git for version control and organized, accessible cloud storage of certain project files</li>
                        <li>While I have some public repositories for personal projects, most of my GitHub use is private</li>
                        <li>You can find my GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/justinciocoi">here</a></li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Docker and DockerHub

                        <li>After dealing with countless portability issues, and not being taught about containerization in school, I have began to teach myself how to use Docker</li>
                        <li>I have a basic understanding of containerization and docker, including docker files, DockerHub, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>QEMU
                    <ul class="tinyList">
                        <li>Since moving onto ARM architecture for my personal laptop, most hypervisors were no longer available</li>
                        <li>I was then left in a position where I would either have to pay for a hypervisor frontend, or learn how to use the backend myself</li>
                        <li>Since that, I have been using QEMU as my main emulation and virtualization backend, as using QEMU directly can give your virtual hardware far better performance</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
